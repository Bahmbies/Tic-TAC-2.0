## Planning | Development | Problem Solving 
To build this Tic - Tac - 468 game, I had to start thinking like a engineer piece by piece to break everything down to fully understand what exactly I wanted to build, I used user stories to figure out what exactly I want to be able to do as a gamer. I took that information and built a wireframe to map out functionality and see what I wanted to make.
Now came to the part of actually making my necessary files and folders in VS code to organize and modulize my work so if anyone else (like you) wanted to read my code they could understand the routes and paths and what connects where and why. I used my HTML to build out my browser template of what I wanted to be shown and help build my SPA. When I run into problems I would reach out to my instructor by making an issue, and reaching out to Colleagues. My main resources were our classes repos, and recordings, and Colleagues. Going through my many problem solving steps as in reading through my code and reaching out to instructors and classmates really helped me figure out those hard problems.
